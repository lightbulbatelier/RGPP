# Welcome to the RealArcade Games Preservation Project!

This archive contains an important amount of games that were released by the now defunct RealArcade (RealOne Arcade) service provider, one of the most influential games distributor during the golden age of the Web Games, right before the rise of the Mobile Gaming era started with the very first iPhone.


### Status

The list is a far incomplete, work-in-progress effort made by volunteers, albeit it is a good starting point for unifying all possible RealArcade setup files around the net and physical media. 231 games have been preserved here for historical purposes as of December 30th, 2020.


### About RGS installer files

RGS is RealNetworks' proprietary format for encapsulating Web Games. These files are only usable within RealArcade. These installers interact with RealArcade's catalog file before installing. If the RGS file is newer than the user's catalog file, it refuses to install until a newer version is downloaded. It's seen the very first beta version of RealArcade and the latest one, v1.4, ignore those checks. You can download a frozen Catalog file from this site. To install, replace your RealArcade Catalog folder with the ZIP archive.


### Instructions

First make sure you are installing the RealArcade games client. This archive recommends you to install v1.2.0.1256 for compatibility reasons. Once installed, download any RGS from this site and double-click on them. The game should install shortly. Unless said otherwise, all RGS are 60-minute demo files.


### Legal Agreements

Any legal agreement between the user and the game developer should still be respected. Always read the EULA before you do anything. We also encourage supporting the game publishers buying a copy if possible from current web game stores.


### Acknowledgements

The RealArcade Games Preservation Project was made possible thanks to Bowlerb, Marli, HMVocaloid, MatthewH12 and Nicolas Bahamondes. Our voluntary contribution will help on preserving the digital heritage of the self-proclaimed Age of Downloadable Web Games (1998-2008).
